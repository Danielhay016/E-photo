# E-photo

"E-photo" is a web application that manages a store for purchasing photos.
On this site, users can purchase photos from the store, view their profile containing their data, contact us and receive information about the site.
Each user connects to the website using the email and password they registered with.


## Project Description
Our project is based on the MVC architecture and uses MongoDB database.


MODEL-
We support two different user types: client users and administrator users.
As a result, additional pages and functionality are displayed when logged in as an administrator user.


VIEW-
Its role is to convert the model data into a representation that allows users to perform action.
The view is an HTML page, and the source code collects dynamic information for the page.


CONTROLLER-
Our controller processes and responds to events that occur on the display, usually in response to the user's actions.
In processing the events, the controller may change the information in the model through the operation of services defined in it.

## Installation
This project is a web application implemented in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

To connect to the site, you need to run the server.
